You read all these rags to riches stories, and you absolutely do not want to have crypto FOMO. However, hidden behind few hundred folks who have made fortune, are thousands or millions who have lost money in many crypto scams. As an investor you need to be able to spot and avoid these scam cryptocurrencies. 
                                        This is even more important for new tokens, which are marketed heavily and being penny cryptocurrency have low barrier to investment. Eventually many of them will get rugpulled or dumped, and the token developers will run away with all the investor money.

                                    <p>The easiest way to make fortune out of cryptocurrency is to be an early investor in a promising cryptocurrency. To find such early yet promising projects, you need to do through analysis and research of token fundamentals. There is simply obscene number of tokens being released every day and it becomes exceedingly difficult to get all the information that you need to look at before buying. As a result, you end up relying on the partial information shared by the developers (devs) in their marketing posts or manipulated comments on reddit like forums.  The result, you become the victim of pump and dump cryptocurrency. Not only you lose your investment on these scam coins, but it also degrades our trust in cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi).

                                    <p>The value of liquidity pools (LP) in USD. It is an important metric for a newly released coin. To facilitate trading over an exchange like PancakeSwap, devs have to create a liquidity pool (LP). Since LPs are created by pooling in BNB or other tokens of value, it represents an investment and commitment from the devs. A 100K worth of BNB tokens thrown in to create an LP pool is a good sign. </p>
                                    <p>If a liquidity pool with at least $100K worth (considering only BNB/BUSD value) exists, you should see something like below. Please note the locked value and links to the LP token on BscScan are provided.</p>

                                    <p>The percentage of "tradable" token supply allocated to the liquidity pools. This is easily the most overlooked metric for a new token. After releasing a token, devs own the entire supply. They might burn some, airdrop or presale few. However, they would typically still own most of the "tradable" supply. To improve optics, they may distribute it over multiple wallets with no whale visible in holders list. If a high percentage of "tradable" token supply is allocated to LPs (which should be locked btw, more on that later), devs share is reduced and they cannot benefit from dumping their share. Otherwise, only with a small appreciation in the token price, they can benefit by dumping their share. For an intuitive idea, if devs own 90% "tradable" supply of a token and have created a high value LP with 10% supply, when devs dump all their share they will get back 90% (actually more than that) of their LP investments even if no one else ever traded their tokens. And when they manage to get few people to buy and increase the token prices, devs can make hefty profits even with locked LP. For newly released tokens, LP Token allocation percentage should be as high as possible, yes 100% is ideal but a 20ish % number is generally good indicator.</p>

Devs would renounce their right to withdraw liquidity by locking their LP tokens in a timed locker.
