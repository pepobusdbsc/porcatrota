For example, if you choose 2 as decimal precision, the smallest denomination would be a .01 token. This unit is known as wei and is similar to a penny (A U.S. dollar is only divisible into 100 units—pennies because the decimal precision is 2). If you are unsure what it means, use 18.

                                    <p>The transaction fee % used to add liquidity to PancakeSwap V2. <br/><br/> This mechanics automatically increases the liquidity pool, enhancing price stability and allowing for larger token trading volumes. The token mint adds a liquidity pool pair (token - BNB) in PancakeSwap v2. The fee will be collected from all transactions as a percentage of the transaction token amount. Once the contract holding exceeds 0.1% of total supply, an automated liquidity add will be executed on a sell transaction. During addition, the first half of the tokens are swapped with BNBs and then the next half and BNBs are used to add funds to the LP pool. The LP tokens created are burned and are not assigned to the owner wallet. This mechanics has been popular by SafeMoon. <br/><br/> You can choose between 0 to 10 percent and can change this fee after token mint.

                                    <p>The transaction fee % used to buyback tokens. <br/><br/> The phrase "buyback" is used in the stock market to denote when a company buys back its own stock on the open market, hence increasing the stock's value. When the market is experiencing selling, the transaction fees are used to buy back and burn tokens. These purchases not only add more value (BNBs) to the liquidity pool but also limit the overall circulating supply of tokens, causing the price to rise quickly and avoiding large dumps. Also known as hyper-deflationary, this mechanics has been made popular by tokens like EverRise.
                                       The fee will be collected from all transactions as a percentage of the transaction token amount. Once the contract holding exceeds 0.1% of the total supply, automated swap will be executed on a sell transaction and BNB will be added to the token contract. Once the BNB balance of the contract exceeds 1 BNB, on a sell transaction 1% of the available BNB balance will be used to buy back tokens. <br/><br/> You can choose this fee to be between 0 to 10 percent and can change this fee after token mint.

                                        All the fee mechanics execution (except fee to holders which reflects immediately) like fee transfer to wallet or automatic liquidity add happens in batches. The fee gets collected on every transaction and gets accumulated in the token contract. You can verify this by checking the balance of the token contract address. Once the contract has collected tokens equal to or greater than 0.1% of the total supply, the fee transfer happens (to the wallet and any other mechanics like burn or liquidity add) on the next sell transaction. It is done only on a sell transaction to not penalize buyers or other transfers because of the high gas fee required to do such transfers. The sell transactions are the ones where you swap tokens with Pancakeswap BNB liquidity pool.
